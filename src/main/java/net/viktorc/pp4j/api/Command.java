/**
 * An interface that defines methods that provide a textual command instruction and allow for the processing of the outputs of the process
 * in response to the instruction. Besides possible processing activities, the {@link #isProcessed(String, boolean)} method is also
 * responsible for determining when the process finished processing the command. E.g. if a process takes the command "go" which triggers the
 * execution of a long-running task, and it prints "ready" to its standard out stream once the task is completed, the method should only
 * return true if the output "ready" has been written to the standard out, in any other case, it should return false (unless perhaps an
 * error message is printed to the standard error stream). The interface also defines a method that is called before the execution of
 * chained commands with the previous command as its parameter to determine whether the current command should be executed based on the
 * results of the previous commands.
