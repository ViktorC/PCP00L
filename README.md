A small library that provides a pool for maintaining pre-started 'interactive' processes. A pool can be created by constructing a [*PSPPool*](https://viktorc.github.io/PSPPool/net/viktorc/pspp/PSPPool) instance. The first parameter of its constructors is an implementation of the [*ProcessManager*](https://viktorc.github.io/PSPPool/net/viktorc/pspp/ProcessManager) interface. This implementation is responsible for handling the start up and possibly the termination of the processes kept in the pool. Other parameters of the *PSPPool* constructors include the minimum and maximum size of the pool, a so called 'reserve size', and the time interval after which idle processes in the pool should be terminated. The size of the pool is always kept between the minimum pool size and the maximum pool size (both inclusive). The reserve size specifies the minimum number of threads that should always be available. Once the process pool is initialized, it accepts commands in the form of implementations of the [*Submission*](https://viktorc.github.io/PSPPool/net/viktorc/pspp/Submission) interface. Such an implementation contains one or more [*Command*](https://viktorc.github.io/PSPPool/net/viktorc/pspp/Command) instances and a boolean value that determines whether the process should be terminated after the execution of the submission. The submission is assigned to any one of the available processes in the pool. While executing a submission, the process cannot accept further submissions. The *Command* implementations allow for the communication with the process via its standard in and standard/error out. This implementation specifies the instruction to send to the process' standard in and handles the output generated by the process as a response to the instruction. Moreover, the *Command* instance also determines when the message may be considered processed and when the process is ready for the next instruction. The library also provides some basic implementations of the *ProcessManager*, *Submission*, and *Command* interfaces to allow for the concise definition of process pooling systems for typical situations. The complete Javadoc can be found [here](http://viktorc.github.io/PSPPool/).
